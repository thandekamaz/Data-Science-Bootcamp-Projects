The objective of this program is to create a function that processes a grid containing '#' representing mines and '-' representing mine-free spots. The function outputs a modified grid where each '-' is replaced with a digit indicating the number of mines adjacent to that spot, considering both horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions.
